Wishlist:

Current:

- Investigate the use of local LLMs instead of the apple translation system. (Ollama and LM Studio)

- Investigate the use of online LLMs

- Translation of Labels and general accessibility conforms for AppStore release

Future:

- Delete of files when they are on the default folder instead of "Remove from Sidebar" which does nothing currently. Eg. default folder can import files to it but not delete.

- Investigate whether files and directory listing are refreshed when changed (files deleted elsewhere for example)

- Add option for RTL and Vertical text for each language panel (Original and translations)

- HomeBrew support

- App Store release

- transloaded.app website
